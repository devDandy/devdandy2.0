        <description>I reached out to Brady Nissenin early 2017 to inquire about creating his business's website. 
        The goal with his website was to establish an online presence, attract customers, and bring awareness to his business in the Des Moines Area.NissenERT's design is a content first approach to differntiate itself from competitors where most of their information was out-of-place or too busy to obtain information. 
        The design was created in Adobe Xd and then I developed the website using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and the Foundation 6 framework. </description>
